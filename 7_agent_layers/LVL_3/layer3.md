# 🧭 Layer 3: Structure, Goals & Behaviors

### **Function & Purpose**
Define agent personality, goals, ethical constraints, and adaptive behaviors. Provide prioritization and self‑improvement loops.

### **Core Components**
- **Goal Management**: Define/track/prioritize objectives
- **Personality Engine**: Adaptive traits and interaction style
- **Ethical Framework**: Safety guidelines and constraints
- **Self‑Improvement**: Learn from local resources and outcomes

### **Current Implementation Status** ❌ **0% Complete**

#### **✅ What's Implemented**
- None (planned)

#### **❌ What's Missing**
- Goal definition and prioritization
- Personality and ethical frameworks
- Learning loops tied to Memory and outcomes

### **Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Foundations (Week 1-2)**
- Minimal goal tracker + priorities; link to Memory for context
- Define initial ethical rules; logging for violations

#### **Phase 2: Adaptive Traits (Week 3-4)**
- Update traits from feedback; store evolution entries
- Generate learning goals from resource index and failures

#### **Phase 3: Self‑Improvement (Week 5-6)**
- Periodic consolidation of learned patterns into goals
- Adjust priorities via performance metrics
