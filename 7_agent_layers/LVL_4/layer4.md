# 🧠 Layer 4: Agent Brain (Reasoning & Planning)

### **Function & Purpose**
Provide reasoning, decision‑making, problem‑solving, and planning to transform intents and context into executable plans.

### **Core Components**
- **LLM Integration**
- **Reasoning Engine** (logical/analytical/creative)
- **Planning System** (task decomposition, resource allocation)
- **Decision Engine** (policy‑aware choices)

### **Current Implementation Status** ❌ **0% Complete**

#### **✅ What's Implemented**
- None (planned)

#### **❌ What's Missing**
- LLM adapter; chain‑of‑thought scaffolding
- Plan representation and validation
- Cost/latency‑aware decision policies

### **Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 1: LLM Adapter (Week 1-2)**
- Pluggable LLM provider; prompt templates
- Simple plan generation with guardrails

#### **Phase 2: Reasoning (Week 3-4)**
- Multi‑step reasoning; evidence tracking
- Failure analysis and plan revision

#### **Phase 3: Planning (Week 5-6)**
- DAG plan representation; constraints
- Integration with Tool Orchestrator (Layer 5)

## 🧪 Operational Notes
- Log reasoning summaries (safe, compact); avoid sensitive data

## 🎯 Next 48h Priorities
- Implement LLM adapter interface
- Build minimal plan schema and validator
